Image vs. Container
An image is the application we want to run
A Container is an instance of that image running as a process
You can have many containers running off the same image

docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx
nginx is the image
publish exposes port 80 on the host IP
routes the traffic to the container IP, port 80

--name // specifies a name for the container instead of an autogenerated one

docker container logs NAME_OF_CONTAINER //outputs logs for containere

docker container stop ID
docker container rm ID ID // can add -f to force

What happens when we reun docker container run
1. Looks for that image locally in image cache, doesn't find anything
2. Then looks in remote image repository (defaults to Docker Hub)
3. Downloads the latest version (nginx:latest by default)
4. Creates new container based on that image and prepares to start
5. Gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine
6. Opens up port 80 on host and forwards to port 80 in container
7. Starts contianer by using the CMD in the image Dockerfile
