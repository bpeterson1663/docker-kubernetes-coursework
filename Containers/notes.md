Image vs. Container
An image is the application we want to run
A Container is an instance of that image running as a process
You can have many containers running off the same image

docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx
nginx is the image
publish exposes port 80 on the host IP
routes the traffic to the container IP, port 80

--name // specifies a name for the container instead of an autogenerated one

docker container logs NAME_OF_CONTAINER //outputs logs for containere

docker container stop ID
docker container rm ID ID // can add -f to force

What happens when we reun docker container run
1. Looks for that image locally in image cache, doesn't find anything
2. Then looks in remote image repository (defaults to Docker Hub)
3. Downloads the latest version (nginx:latest by default)
4. Creates new container based on that image and prepares to start
5. Gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine
6. Opens up port 80 on host and forwards to port 80 in container
7. Starts contianer by using the CMD in the image Dockerfile

docker container inspect //gives metadata about the containers
docker container stats // live update on resources the container is used

docker container run -it // -i (interactive) and -t (tty) flags

docker container exec -it mysql bash //executes on an existing image

docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}'

Networks
docker network create my_app_net
docker container run -d --name new_nginx --network my_app_net // adds it to the my_app_net network

docker container connect NETWORK_ID CONTAINER_ID
